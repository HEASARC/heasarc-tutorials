# MyST configurations
# Adding amsmath and dollarmath enables LaTeX style math environments
# The smartquotes extension will automatically convert '' and "" to their nice typeset open and closed versions
# The substitution extension allows us to define keys that will be substituted for a value set in the frontmatter
#  or a centralized file - will be good for defining a value we might want to change everywhere easily
# The colon_fence extension lets us use ::: in place of ``` to delimit directives (I am more used to ::: from using
#  MySTMD)
