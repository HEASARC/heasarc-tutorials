# HEASARC Tutorials

A set of Jupyter notebooks created to demonstrate the use of services provided by HEASARC for high-energy astrophysics.

This repository contains tutorials for finding, accessing and analyzing high energy data, as well as research 'use case' notebooks that reproduce results from the literature.

## Using the tutorials

### Directly
This repository is maintained to help make the identification and use of high-energy observations more accessible to the astrophysics community, and we welcome any feedback on or contributions to this set of notebooks. 

If you wish to create a new Jupyter notebook, please use the 'notebook_template.md' file as a starting point - any notebooks that do not follow this template when a pull request is submitted will need to be edited.

### Submitting research notebooks
We also encourage the submission of any Jupyter notebooks from recent publications that you think are a good example of high-energy astrophysics analysis in a Python environment. Please open an issue that briefly explains what your notebook does, why you think it should be included in this repository, and what the software requirements are, as well as attaching the notebook file. We may then decide to convert your notebook to the standard described by the template and include it in this resource.
