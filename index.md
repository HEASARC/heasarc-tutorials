# HEASARC Python Notebook Tutorials

This documentation demonstrates how to access and use high-energy observations and catalogs served by the [NASA High Energy Astrophysics Science Research Archive Center (HEASARC)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) through easy-to-use Python notebooks.
We aim to give every astrophysicist the skills required to make use of high-energy data for their particular research interest, and pull even more scientific value from the missions archived by HEASARC.

## Other related tutorial sets

### IRSA
Another NASA archive center that maintains their own set of tutorials, related mostly to the access and use of infrared observations:

- **GitHub** - [https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/irsa-tutorials](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/irsa-tutorials)
- **Website** - [https://caltech-ipac.github.io/irsa-tutorials/](https://caltech-ipac.github.io/irsa-tutorials/)

Our HEASARC tutorial infrastructure is heavily inspired by the IRSA-tutorials repository; we chose to follow their example and try to conform to ['Scientific Python'](https://github.com/scientific-python) principles.

### MAST
