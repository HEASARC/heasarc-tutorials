# HEASARC Python Notebook Tutorials


These Python Jupyter Notebook tutorials demonstrate access methods and techniques for working with data served by the [NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu).
They cover topics like querying IRSA, working with catalogs in Parquet format, visualizing with Firefly, and general other techniques.

## Other noteworthy tutorial sets

### IRSA
Another NASA archive center that maintains their own set of tutorials, related mostly to the access and use of infrared observations:

- **GitHub** - [https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/irsa-tutorials](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/irsa-tutorials)
- **Website** - [https://caltech-ipac.github.io/irsa-tutorials/](https://caltech-ipac.github.io/irsa-tutorials/)

Our HEASARC tutorial infrastructure is heavily inspired by the IRSA-tutorials repository; we chose to follow their example and try to conform to ['Scientific Python'](https://github.com/scientific-python) principles.

### MAST
Another NASA archive center that maintains their own set of tutorials, related mostly to using optical and UV observations:
